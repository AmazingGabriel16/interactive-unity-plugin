## Contribute Back!

Is there a feature missing that you'd like to see, or found a bug that you have a fix for? Or do you have an idea or just interest in helping out in building the library? Let us know and we'd love to work with you. For a good starting point on where we are headed and feature ideas, take a look at our [requested features and bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-beam-api/issues).  

Big or small we'd like to take your contributions back to help improve the Xbox Live Service API for everyone. 

## Having Trouble?

We'd love to get your review score, whether good or bad, but even more than that, we want to fix your problem. If you submit your issue as a Review, we won't be able to respond to your problem and ask any follow-up questions that may be necessary. The most efficient way to do that is to open an issue in our [issue Tracker](https://github.com/WatchBeam/interactive-unity-plugin/issues).
